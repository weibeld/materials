## Summary

Presentation of the [EDB Postgres for Kubernetes](https://operatorhub.io/operator/cloud-native-postgresql) operator.

The operator is developed by [EDB](https://www.enterprisedb.com/company).

## Discussion

The operator seems to be robust and complete. It includes backups to an object storage, Grafana dashboards and more, and it seems to be enterprise-ready.

An open question is how it relates to other available PostreSQL operators.
