## Summary

Explaining different ways of creating a Zero Trust architecture with Azure AD and OpenID Connect or OAuth2.

- Zero Trust:
    - Every request to every service is authenticated
    - This contrasts with the traditional way in which there is a central firewall and everything behind it is a secure network that doesn't require authentication
