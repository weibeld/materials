- Software supply chain security:
  1. Self-written code (10-20%)
  1. Open-source code (80-90%)
    - 80% of vulnerabiliies are found here
  1. Linux packages
  1. Cloud infrastructure
- Snyk provides a Developer Security Platform
  - Provides security checks and fixes across the entire software lifetime, from code merges over CI/CD to continuous monitoring in the cloud
  - Also provides automated remediation that also displays the chain of fixes
  - The main purpose is to detect vulnerabilities in the code, warn about them, and provide fixes
- Demo with [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.com/) about how Snyk can detect a rmote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in [md-to-pdf](https://github.com/simonhaenisch/md-to-pdf)
