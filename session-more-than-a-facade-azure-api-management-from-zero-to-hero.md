## Summary

Explanation of the [Azure API Management](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/api-management/) service:

- Central gateway for all APIs (Azure services, Azure APIs, external APIs...)
    - Similar as [Amazon API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/)
- Provides version management, authentication, protection (e.g. DDoS), request and response modification, caching, usage tracking, etc.
- Also provides a developer portal that summarises the APIs that can be consumed by developers (e.g. showing the OpenAPI specification of each API)
